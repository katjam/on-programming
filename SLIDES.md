- Developing software in small teams about 15 years. Work with non-profits to build digital tools that compliment their over-stretched services
- I don't identify as a computer scientist or engineer - I just like using code to make stuff
- not a mathematician nor a speedy typist don't need that to write reliable User Interfaces

- ultimately we need to tell the computer what we want it to do in every eventuality
- later if what we want it to do changes, someone else - or us will have to understand the instructions we wrote so they can be altered
- if the technology changes 
- if someone does something we weren't anticipating, they find a bug - beacause computers are not intelligent - they only know how to do the things we program them to do

- Our ultimate goal is reliable apps
- Like a house of cards - what you do will be added to
- Write code that is easy to understand later
- We have a finite amount of time. Try to spend it building, testing and designing features; not discovering, discussing and fixing bugs.
